> Keep your audio balance from drifting!

There is, *still*, a long standing MacOS bug where your balance may drift when volume buttons are pressed while CPU is under heavy load 🤷‍♀️ (Also [charging your Macbook on the left side can cause heavy CPU usage](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/363337/how-to-find-cause-of-high-kernel-task-cpu-usage/363933)).

Ever noticed your audio not quite right? Only to discover your audio balance slightly off 😔

This free app keeps your balance stable and center. Lives in your Menu Bar.

## FAQ

- **Why can I not open the app after installing?**<br>
  As a security measure MacOS won't open apps from unidentified developers.
  This is because I do not have an Apple Developers subscription, so cannot sign the app.
  To open see https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25088?locale=en_US

- **How do I stop the app from centering balance?**<br>
  Two options:
  1. Quit the app from the menu bar option<br>
  OR
  1. Disable the app with the menu bar option

- **After hiding the menu bar icon, how do I make it reappear?**<br>
  Open `ballast.app` from your Applications folder or open via spotlight, alfred etc. A window should be displayed with an option to restore the menu bar icon or keep hidden.
